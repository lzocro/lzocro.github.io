From the 23rd to the 27th of September 2024, I, along with <a href="https://antonio-ocello.github.io/"> Antonio Ocello </a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=OpnTGC0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"> Gregoire Szymanski </a>, held the workshop <a href="https://antonio-ocello.github.io/WorkshopFinML/index.html"> Mathematical Insights from Markets, Control, and Learning </a>, at the <a href="https://www.caes.cnrs.fr/sejours/centre-paul-langevin-3-2/"> Centre Paul Langevin </a> in  Aussois (France).

This workshop aimed to bring together junior researchers working at the intersection of Machine Learning and Finance, with a focus on fostering interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations. The program featured two short courses, on mean-field games (given by A. Ocello) and reinforcement learning (which I gave), as well as invited talks and shorter-form talks by the 27 participants. 

 The workshop was fully funded by soliciting funding from established research programs (<a href="https://futures-quantitative-finance.u-paris.fr/">Futures of Quantitative finance</a>), institutions (<a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">Ecole Polytechnique</a>, <a href="https://www.cmap.ip-paris.fr/">CMAP</a>, <a href="https://u-paris.fr/">Université Paris-Cité</a>), and private sponsors (BNP Paribas, QRT), and by winning two grants from the <a href="http://smai.emath.fr/"> SMAI </a> and the <a href="https://fondation-hadamard.fr/"> FMJH </a>.
