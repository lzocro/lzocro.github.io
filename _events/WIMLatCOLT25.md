At COLT 2025, I helped <a href="https://www.cvernade.com/">Claire Vernade</a> in organizing the Women in Machine Learning (WiML) social event. Together we planned an icebreaker activity in which participants pick up a card describing a trivia fact (e.g. "procrastinates writing with typesetting") and have to find a person to whom it applies, after which they trade cards and repeat the process. The event saw around 50 participants, and was greatly appreciated by the attendees. 

If you are interested in using the same ice-breaker or would like help organising WiML or similar events at future conferences, please feel welcome to reach out!
