I am a Ramon-Llull (MSCA Cofund) postdoctoral fellow at <a href='https://www.upf.edu/en/'>UPF</a> in Barcelona working with <a href="https://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/">Gergely Neu</a> and <a href='https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson'>Anders Jonsson</a> as part of the <a href='https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml'>the AI & ML group</a>. Prior, I was a postdoc at <a href='https://www.ensae.fr/recherche/centre-de-recherche-en-economie-et-statistique-crest'>CREST</a> in <a href='https://www.ensae.fr/'>ENSAE</a> working with <a href="https://vianney.ai/">Vianney Perchet<a> as part of the <a href='https://www.inria.fr/fr/fairplay'>FairPlay</a> Inria team.
I have a Ph.D. in applied Mathematics from <a href='https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/en'>Université Paris Dauphine</a> and <a href='https://ailab.criteo.com/'>Criteo AI Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/brunobouchard'>Bruno Bouchard</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0WsQ0uUAAAAJ">Marc Abeille</a>. :fr: :uk: :new_zealand:

I am an applied mathematician with interests across Analysis, Probability, and Statistics, centered on questions of decision theory under uncertainty. I have worked on bandit optimisation and including reinforcement learning, on stochastic control and optimal transport, and more! My research includes a significant interdisciplinary component in Computer Science (ML, algorithms with predictions) and Economics (Games, auctions). I'm always happy to discuss cool problems, drop me an email.

Welcome to my Home page! You can find an organised overview of my work in [projects](/projects), or directly visit the list of [publications](/publications). [Events](/events) collects things I organise, and on [blog](/blog) I may (one day) post small musings. My CV is available as a [page](/cv) or as a direct download therein.
