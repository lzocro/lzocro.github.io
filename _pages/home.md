Postdoc at <a href='https://www.ensae.fr/recherche/centre-de-recherche-en-economie-et-statistique-crest'>CREST</a> in <a href='https://www.ensae.fr/'>ENSAE</a> working with <a href="https://vianney.ai/">Vianney Perchet<a> as part of the <a href='https://www.inria.fr/fr/fairplay'>FairPlay</a> Inria team.
I have a Ph.D. in applied Mathematics from <a href='https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/en'>Universit√© Paris Dauphine</a> and <a href='https://ailab.criteo.com/'>Criteo AI Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/brunobouchard'>Bruno Bouchard</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0WsQ0uUAAAAJ">Marc Abeille</a>. :fr: :uk: 

I am an applied mathematician with interests across Analysis, Probability, and Statistics, specialising in questions of decision theory under uncertainty. I have worked on Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning (including Bandits), Optimal Transport, Hawkes processes, Auction Theory, and more! My research includes a significant interdisciplinary component in Computer Science and Economics. I'm always happy to discuss cool problems, drop me an email.
